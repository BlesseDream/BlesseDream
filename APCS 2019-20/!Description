!Description
This is all the code that I have written during my time in high school.
The shorter ones are homework assignments that can be run alone with a potenial corresponding test class.
However, due to technical issues known as getting used to GitHub and being too idotic to create a backup,
supporting files needed to run the larger code made for projects was deleted. All code here was recovered
from the submission folder.
